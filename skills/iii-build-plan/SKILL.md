# Station III: Build Plan (`iii-build-plan`)

This skill implements **Station III (Build)** of the 8-station pipeline (stations `i`–`vii` plus orchestrator `x-workflow-issue`). It works across **any project, language, or repository**, consuming the task plan from `tasks/plan.md` (created in Station II by `ii-plan-issue`) and executing implementation through disciplined type-aware builds, official documentation grounding, incremental commits, and code simplification.

> **Note on Verification:** Final pre-push verification (browser DevTools check for UI or complete test suite run for code) is executed systematically in **Station IV (`iv-review-build-and-pr`)** after multi-axis review and fixes are complete.

## Pipeline Position
- **Station:** Station III of VII (`vii` = stations `i`–`vii`; plus `x-workflow-issue` = 8 total)
- **Previous Station:** `ii-plan-issue` (Plan)
- **Next Station:** `iv-review-build-and-pr` (Review & Verify)

## 1. Invocation & Execution Modes

This command supports two execution modes:

### Mode A: Full Autonomous Execution (`/iii-build-plan auto` or `/iii-build-plan all`) — Recommended
- Sequentially executes **all tasks in `tasks/plan.md`** one after another.
- Per task: reads domain tag ➔ routes to specialized skill ➔ implements minimal clean code ➔ simplifies code ➔ creates local commit ➔ marks task completed ➔ advances to next task.
- **When does it pause?** Only if a critical compilation blocker occurs or an irreversible/high-risk action requires operator sign-off.

### Mode B: Single Task Execution (`/iii-build-plan`)
- Picks only the **single next open task** from `tasks/plan.md`.
- Implements it, simplifies code, creates a local commit, marks the task `[x]`, and **halts immediately** for inspection.

---

## 2. Per-Task Execution Protocol (Under the Hood)

For every task executed, follow these phases:

### Phase 1: Pre-flight & Specialized Skill Routing
1. **Verify Plan:** Confirm `tasks/plan.md` exists. If missing, halt: "No plan found! Run `/ii-plan-issue` first."
2. **Quality Guardrails:** Respect constraints from `CONSTRAINTS.md` (anti-cheat, forbidden edits, zero regressions).
3. **Rule 0 — simplicity before writing:** for every task, first ask "what is the simplest thing that fully works?" The boring, shortest solution wins; complexity must justify itself before it gets written.
4. **Risk-first order:** follow the plan's task order (risk-first from Station II); when the plan leaves freedom, take the riskiest, most-uncertain task first — while being wrong is still cheap.
5. **Route & Invoke Domain Skill:** Inspect the task's domain tag in `tasks/plan.md` and invoke the matching specialized skill (full matrix in `references/routing.md`):
   - **UI / Frontend / Design:** Activate `frontend-ui-engineering` (and `tailwind-design-system` if applicable). Identify what visual components, styling, or layouts are missing or broken, and implement them across the project according to modern standards.
   - **Code / Backend / API:** Activate `test-driven-development`, `source-driven-development`, and `api-and-interface-design`. When the task is test-writing-heavy, deploy the `tdd-guide` agent persona (from this repo's `agents/` directory): write-tests-first, ~80%+ coverage on touched code. Persona not found on disk → skip and record the skip (never invent).
   - **Debug / Defect:** Activate `debugging-and-error-recovery` (investigate root cause before writing fixes).
   - **Performance:** Activate `performance-optimization`.
   - **Security:** Activate `security-and-hardening`.
   - **Docs:** Activate `documentation-and-adrs`.

### Phase 2: Implementation (Type-Aware Build)
- **Code Tasks:** Follow TDD — write minimal clean code to fulfill the requirement.
- **Design & UI Tasks:** Ground styles in existing project tokens and components; implement accessible, responsive UI structure.
- **Official Docs Grounding:** When using modern or external libraries, consult official documentation (`source-driven-development`) to ensure correct API usage.
- **Build Error Resolution:** If compiler, syntax, or import failures occur, deploy the matching `<stack>-build-resolver` agent persona from this repo's `agents/` directory (`build-error-resolver` generic; `react-build-resolver` / `go-build-resolver` / `rust-build-resolver` when the diff touches React / Go / Rust): minimal diffs only — no architectural edits — get the build green, then resume the task. Persona not found on disk → apply the generic surgical-fix loop and record the skip.
- **NOTICED-BUT-NOT-TOUCHING:** anything spotted mid-build that is out of scope — a bug in adjacent code, a tempting refactor, a quick win — is never touched. Capture it as a one-line future Issue candidate and surface it in the closing report; the operator decides whether it becomes an Issue.
- **Feature flags / safe defaults / rollback:** for risky behavior changes, prefer a feature flag or a safe default that keeps the old behavior reachable; keep every task rollback-friendly (atomic commits, no destructive data changes without a path back). `git-workflow-and-versioning` governs commit discipline: atomic commits, ~100-line change sizing, commit-as-save-point.
- **Observability touchpoint:** when a task changes production-facing behavior (API responses, background jobs, integrations), add — or note in the report as a follow-up — the instrumentation it needs (structured log, metric) per `observability-and-instrumentation`.

### Phase 3: Code Simplification & Hygiene
- Run `code-simplification`: remove dead scratch code, prune unnecessary abstractions, and ensure clarity without changing behavior.
- Confirm zero accidental file changes or unneeded package installations.

### Phase 4: Local Commit & Task Mark-Off
- Stage the files touched for this specific task.
- Commit locally: `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (#<issue>)`.
- Mark the task as `[x]` in `tasks/plan.md`.
- Once all tasks are complete, hand off to **Station IV (`iv-review-build-and-pr`)** for code review, final verification, and PR creation.

## Chat Output Contract

At the conclusion of Station III, you MUST report to the user in clean, everyday English using this exact structured format.
Part A (what to check yourself) adapts to what was actually built — pick 2-3 checks, never a fixed list.
Part B (the two paths + router) is always shown in full, with every skill in backticks except the dead-button row, which is routed automatically inside the router skill.

```markdown
# 🔨 Build Summary:

## 🎨 What was built — visual look:
[Show visually in the chat what was built — table / diagram / flow chart / shapes, whatever fits and helps the explanation. Examples: before → after table, flow chart of the change, screen or component structure. The visual must fit the content — never force-fill]

## 🛠️ Skills used and what was actually done:
* **`[first skill name, e.g.: frontend-ui-engineering]`:** [concrete explanation: what was missing or broken, and what the skill fixed or built across the project]
* **`[second skill name, e.g.: test-driven-development / api-and-interface-design]`:** [what was done with it: backend logic implementation and test writing]
* **`code-simplification`:** [what was cleaned and how the code stayed lean and simple]

---

## 🧠 Concise summary:
* **The problem:** [one plain sentence: what was broken or missing]
* **How the build solved it:** [one plain sentence: what was built and how it solves it]

---

## 👀 What to check yourself:
[2-3 checks per what was actually built — button/form built: click and verify result. Screen built: mobile and large screen. Logic built: correct result with no error. Existing code changed: what worked before still works]

## 👉 Where next — two paths:
* **All good, no comments** -> `/iv-review-build-and-pr` — review, final verification, branch push and PR opening.
* **Have a comment / bug / change** -> `/iiib-iterate-after-build` + free-text description in your words. It routes on its own and fixes locally with no push:
  - Bug / error -> `diagnosing-bugs` + `debugging-and-error-recovery`
  - Dead button with no error -> `click-path-audit`
  - Design / mobile -> `frontend-ui-engineering`
  - Slow -> `performance-optimization`
  - Security -> `security-and-hardening`
```
