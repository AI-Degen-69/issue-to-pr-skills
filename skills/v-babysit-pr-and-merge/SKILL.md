# Station V: Babysit PR and Merge (`v-babysit-pr-and-merge`)

A global, model-agnostic habit: ensure every branch is pushed and opened as a PR (or handed off directly from Station IV `iv-review-build-and-pr`), then sit on the PR through review until it is mergeable. Every comment is triaged, every dismissal carries a reason, review waiting follows a deterministic **5m → 4m → 3m → 2m → 1m** countdown check cycle, the review loop runs **exactly one focused round** (to conserve CodeRabbit quota and eliminate review churn), auto-triggers `@coderabbitai review` if auto-review is not invoked or was skipped, and concludes — merged or escalated.

## Pipeline Position
- **Station:** Station V of VI
- **Previous Station:** `iv-review-build-and-pr` (Review & Ship)
- **Next Station:** `vi-close-pipeline` (Close Pipeline — prune, issue close, clean-exit gate)

**Zero human in the loop.** Extraction, triage, rejection replies, thread resolution, code application, test verification, self-healing, commit, push, and merge are all performed autonomously by the agent. The operator is contacted only if critical blockers cannot be resolved.

## When to use

- Hand-off immediately after Station IV (`iv-review-build-and-pr`) to track CodeRabbit review and merge the PR.
- Working changes or commits exist on a feature branch with no PR yet — Station V delegates opening to `iv-review-build-and-pr`, then starts babysitting once the PR exists.
- A PR was created or pushed, requiring CodeRabbit review tracking.
- Review comments arrive on an open PR.
- Before merging, to confirm zero unhandled blocking feedback.

## Multi-PR Priority Order & Pipelining

Multiple open PRs and no specific number → follow `references/multi-pr-pipelining.md`
(stack dependencies first; pipelining only inside wait windows).

## Step Map (load the detail on demand)

| Step | What it does | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 0** | Ship handshake — find the PR, or delegate to `iv-review-build-and-pr` | `references/review-loop.md` |
| **Step 1** | Verify the `@coderabbitai review` trigger, then wait out the 5m→4m→3m→2m→1m countdown and classify completion honestly — a summary-only review with zero inline findings (private repo on Free) is `SUMMARY_ONLY`, **not** a clean pass | `references/review-loop.md` |
| **Step 2** | Pull every comment via the API; triage each one yourself — ACCEPT or REJECT, no rubber-stamping | `references/triage-and-apply.md` |
| **Step 2B** | Agent fallback review when CodeRabbit is rate-limited, skipped, or stuck on `processing`; probe `@coderabbitai configuration` first when a review contradicts the committed config | `references/triage-and-apply.md` |
| **Step 3** | Late rejections — pointer only, Step 2.4 is the one canonical REJECT flow | `references/triage-and-apply.md` |
| **Step 4** | Apply accepted fixes (Type A suggestions / Type B intent), run targeted tests, self-heal, one batch commit, reply to and resolve every thread | `references/triage-and-apply.md` |
| **Step 5** | GitHub CI is the merge gate; post `@coderabbitai resolve` to close the review loop, then squash-merge, or deploy a `<stack>-build-resolver` persona on failure | `references/merge-and-reset.md` |
| **Step 5a** | Close the issue — verify GitHub auto-closed it via `Closes #<id>`, or close manually if it missed | `references/merge-and-reset.md` |
| **Step 5b** | Return the local checkout to a clean, fast-forwarded base and delete the merged branch **locally and on the remote** (`git push origin --delete`, after the `MERGED` guard) | `references/merge-and-reset.md` |

**Round exit condition:** zero unresolved threads carrying a REJECT, and zero threads
resolved without an inline reply. Then CI, then merge, then reset — always, merge or escalate.

## Standing Rules

- **Zero human in the loop:** Extraction, triage, replies, thread resolution, code application, verification, self-healing, commit, push, and merge run autonomously. Escalate only if critical blockers cannot be resolved.
- **Full autonomy on GitHub operations:** Agent commits, pushes, creates PRs, and merges without requiring manual sign-offs.
- **Mandatory inline reply on every resolution:** Every single resolved thread MUST have an explicit inline reply (`ACCEPT: <summary of fix>` or `REJECT: <concrete technical reason>`) posted before resolution via `repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:pr/comments/:id/replies`. Never resolve silently, and never run blind bulk resolutions that close unaddressed or newly arrived comments.
- **Programmatic extraction only:** Read review comments via `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<pr_number>/comments` (`id`, `path`, `line`, `start_line`, `body`) — never by eyeballing rendered PR HTML.
- **Manual review trigger:** CodeRabbit never auto-reviews. `iv-review-build-and-pr` posts `@coderabbitai review` right after opening the PR. Never treat a green check as a review — read the check text.
- **One trigger per PR — HARD RULE:** check for an existing `@coderabbitai review` comment (or PR body) FIRST; post a trigger only when none exists anywhere. An existing trigger is never re-posted, re-verified, or "confirmed", and an old/unacknowledged bot reply does NOT license a second trigger — after one review the round is spent, the quota is gone, and a new trigger is guaranteed to hit the rate limit. This lock is permanent: pushing the fix commit in Step 4.3 does not unlock a second review.
- **Single review round:** Exactly 1 focused review round to conserve CodeRabbit quota and eliminate review churn. Proceed directly to CI verification and merge after resolving round 1.
- **Countdown polling schedule:** 5 min initial wait (hard minimum — never shorten), then 4 min, 3 min, 2 min, and 1 min checks thereafter. Use non-blocking `schedule` tool instead of long shell sleeps.
- **Thoughtful deliberation:** Never blindly reject suggestions. Evaluate each CodeRabbit suggestion on its technical merits against the codebase, domain spec, and architecture. If it genuinely improves performance, safety, or readability, accept and verify with tests. Only reject if it violates domain specs, introduces bloat, or breaks behavior.
- **Descending line order:** When applying edits to a single file, sort hunks in descending `line` order so earlier line anchors do not drift.
- **Operator milestone updates:** Give concise updates on actions taken (`Working on [branch]...`, `Committed & Pushed...`, `PR Opened #...`, `Merged PR #...`).
- **Pipelined multi-PR processing:** Interleave PR tasks during countdown wait windows.
- **One commit per round:** Batch all accepted fixes into a single commit and push once.
- **No auto-fix on partial rejections:** Never run `@coderabbitai auto-fix` when any comments were rejected. Apply fixes locally and test.
- **Never commit red:** If a suggestion breaks a test, `git checkout <file>`, reply with the failure log, resolve as REJECT, and re-run the targeted tests.
- **Repo conventions win:** Always observe repo-specific PR templates and review rules.
- **Post-merge local reset is mandatory:** After every merge (or abandoned-PR escalation), return the checkout to base: confirm `MERGED` via `gh pr view`, switch to base, `git pull --ff-only`, force-delete the local branch (`-D` only after remote confirms `MERGED` — squash merges are never `-d`-deletable), then delete it **on the remote** with `git push origin --delete` (never remote-first; `--delete-branch` on the merge is best-effort and this repository's `deleteBranchOnMerge` is `false`), then `git fetch --prune`. Fold the remote-delete outcome (deleted / already gone / declined) into the condensed 1–2 line merge summary — never a silent no-op, never a verbose git-ops block. Never reset a dirty tree without committing/stashing first; escalate on ambiguity.

## VI Triage — Skip or Run? (after Step 5b reset, before the report)

After the local reset lands on a clean base, run these three quick checks to decide the vi-close-pipeline recommendation in the report:

1. **Issue state:** `gh issue view <id> --json state --jq .state` — OPEN = 🔴 (must).
2. **Leftover artifacts:** run Station VI's **full** discovery set — never a single narrow `git ls-files` grep. It covers: tracked stale per-issue plans and checklists; untracked scratch in knowledge-home or alternate layouts (`tasks/`, `scratch/`, repo root, or any other path); leftover stashes (`git stash list`); and leftover branches/worktrees (`git branch`, `gh pr status`). Any hit = 🟡 (recommended); hits from 3+ distinct closed issues = 🟡 even without matching the current id. This station recommends — it never prunes, so an under-broad check here silently hands a dirty folder to the next issue.
3. **Git cleanliness:** `git status --porcelain` — non-empty = 🔴 (must).

Pick the highest signal: 🔴 > 🟡 > 🟢. All three clean = 🟢 (skip, continue to `/i-pick-issue`). **When any check is inconclusive** — a stash you cannot attribute, a branch whose owner is unknown, an artifact matching no known issue — it is not 🟢. Classify 🟡 and recommend `/vi-close-pipeline`; uncertain means recommend VI, never skip it.

---

## Report rules (mandatory)

Two reports from the template. The closing What-now states the build is live with a `/present-pr` option, then the repo-state choice: clean skips to `/i-pick-issue`, otherwise run `/vi-close-pipeline` with the reason. PR and issue links are hyperlinks. The summary is 3 quick lines.

- **Condensed merge summary (no verbose git-ops block):** the CI gate, squash-merge SHA, issue-close, local reset, and remote-delete outcomes collapse into 1–2 status rows (`#<id> Closed | #<n> Merged (<sha>) | Branch: <branch> → <base>, clean, synced`). Never narrate each git command with its output — that detail stays in the transcript, not the report.
- **Manual verification walkthrough lives here:** after a successful merge, guide the operator through seeing the change with their own eyes — as many short steps as it takes for clarity, no step cap, each step one quick action in the shape where → what to do → what to see, with `→` arrows and a direct link when one exists. Plain words, no jargon. Name the real screen / tab / button, never the presentation file. Backend-only with nothing to see → one line saying so plus how it was checked automatically. (Moved here from Station VI: verification belongs at merge-time, right after the work lands.)



**Timeout-merge rule:** when `IN_PROGRESS_STUCK` or `RATE_LIMITED`, the `CodeRabbit` check may stay `PENDING` forever. Do NOT wait for it. Merge gate = agent fallback review clean (or its nits triaged) + `gh pr checks` green (excluding the stuck `CodeRabbit` context). State this explicitly in the `CodeRabbit review status` line so the operator knows the merge was NOT on a completed bot review.
