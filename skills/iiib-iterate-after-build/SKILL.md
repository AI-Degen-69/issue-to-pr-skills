description: Station III-B (Iterate After Build) — human feedback fix loop between build and review. Use after iii-build-plan when the operator reports bugs, dead buttons, UI changes, slowness, or security concerns in freshly built code. Classifies each free-text comment, routes to the right specialist skill, fixes locally with atomic commits and no push, then hands off to iv-review-build-and-pr. Invoke whenever the operator lists corrections after a build.

# Station III-B: Iterate After Build (`iiib-iterate-after-build`)

The router for Path B. The operator describes corrections in free text after a build, and this skill classifies each item, fixes it with the right specialist skill, and loops until the build is clean. Nothing is pushed and no PR is opened here — pushing stays in Station IV.

## Pipeline Position

- **Station:** Station III-B of VII (human feedback loop)
- **Previous Station:** `iii-build-plan` (Build)
- **Next Station:** `iv-review-build-and-pr` (Review & Verify)

## 1. Invocation

```bash
/iiib-iterate-after-build <free-text corrections>   # e.g. the save button does nothing and the title is off-center on mobile
/iiib-iterate-after-build                           # no text: ask the operator for the correction list, then proceed
```

The operator never picks a skill. They describe what they saw. Classification is this skill's job.

## 2. Classify & Route

Split the operator message into separate items (one bug or change each). For every item, state one line: "Item N → Lane X because [observable reason]". The full matrix lives in `references/routing.md`:

- **Bug / error / regression** (crash, console error, worked before and broke): `diagnosing-bugs` for the full diagnosis loop (feedback loop, minimise, hypothesise, instrument, fix, regression test), then `debugging-and-error-recovery` for reproduce, localize, fix, and guard.
- **Dead button** (click does nothing, no error): follow the dead-button checklist in [references/click-path-audit.md](references/click-path-audit.md) — trace the handler call by call and find the state write that undoes an earlier one.
- **UI / styling / mobile change** (works but looks wrong): `frontend-ui-engineering` (plus `tailwind-design-system` when design tokens apply).
- **Slow**: `performance-optimization` — profile before optimizing.- **Auth / secrets / untrusted input**: `security-and-hardening`.
- **Unclear**: treat as a bug, ask exactly one focused question, never guess.

## 3. Per-Item Fix Loop

For every item, in order:

1. **Reproduce** the item as the operator described it (click path, error text, screen size).
2. **Name the root cause**, not the symptom. No fix without a named cause.
3. **Apply the minimal fix** with the routed skill. One item, one fix.
4. **Simplify** with `code-simplification`: no dead code, no extra abstractions.
5. **Commit locally**: `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (#<issue>)`. Never push, never open a PR.
6. **Verify**: browser check for UI via `browser-testing-with-devtools` (live DOM, console, network — zero uncaught errors), targeted tests for logic via `test-driven-development`, and `verification-before-completion` against the operator's words. Regression tests go at the seam that actually reproduces the bug (unit, integration, or e2e — whatever reaches the real pattern at the call site); when no correct seam exists, that itself is an architectural finding — record it in the commit and surface it in the report.
7. **Next item.** A red verification stops the loop until green.

## 4. Guardrails

Respect `CONSTRAINTS.md` (no skipped tests, no new external dependencies without approval, zero regressions in touched modules). Never touch code outside the reported items. Never push to origin — `iv-review-build-and-pr` is the only station that pushes.

## Chat Output Contract

Report in clean, everyday English. Write for the customer who ordered the product, never for a developer:

- No code words: never handler, state, side effect, function, commit, test names, or file paths. Say what the person gets now.
- Never use the word console. Say "checked in the browser, no errors" instead.
- One line per comment: what was wrong in plain words, then what works now. One sentence each.

```markdown
# 🔁 Fix Summary (III-B):

## 🧭 Routing:
* **[The comment in your words]** -> `diagnosing-bugs` + `debugging-and-error-recovery`: [Before: what didn't work for the person. Now: what works]
* **[Comment 2]** -> [lane]: [Before / now in the same style]

## ✅ Verification:
* [Checked in the browser: what was clicked and what was seen. No console jargon. Logic: verified that what worked before still works]

👉 **Next step:** `/iv-review-build-and-pr` — everything works, ready for review and shipping.
