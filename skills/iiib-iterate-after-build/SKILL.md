description: Station III-B (Iterate After Build) — human feedback fix loop between build and review. Use after iii-build-plan when the operator reports bugs, dead buttons, UI changes, slowness, or security concerns in freshly built code. Classifies each free-text comment, routes to the right specialist skill, fixes locally with atomic commits and no push, then hands off to iv-review-build-and-pr. Invoke whenever the operator lists corrections after a build.

# Station III-B: Iterate After Build (`iiib-iterate-after-build`)

The router for Path B. The operator describes corrections in free text after a build, and this skill classifies each item, fixes it with the right specialist skill, and loops until the build is clean. Nothing is pushed and no PR is opened here — pushing stays in Station IV.

## Pipeline Position

- **Station:** Station III-B of VI (human feedback loop)
- **Previous Station:** `iii-build-plan` (Build)
- **Next Station:** `iv-review-build-and-pr` (Review & Verify)

## 1. Invocation

```bash
/iiib-iterate-after-build <free-text corrections>   # e.g. the save button does nothing and the title is off-center on mobile
/iiib-iterate-after-build                           # no text: ask the operator for the correction list, then proceed
```

The operator never picks a skill. They describe what they saw. Classification is this skill's job.

## 2. Classify & Route

Split the operator message into separate items (one bug or change each). For every item, state one line: "Item N → Lane X because [observable reason]". The full matrix lives in `references/routing.md`:

- **Bug / error / regression** (crash, console error, worked before and broke): `diagnosing-bugs` for the full diagnosis loop (feedback loop, minimise, hypothesise, instrument, fix, regression test), then `debugging-and-error-recovery` for reproduce, localize, fix, and guard.
- **Dead button** (click does nothing, no error): follow the dead-button checklist in [references/click-path-audit.md](references/click-path-audit.md) — trace the handler call by call and find the state write that undoes an earlier one.
- **UI / styling / mobile change** (works but looks wrong): `frontend-ui-engineering` (plus `tailwind-design-system` when design tokens apply).
- **Slow**: `performance-optimization` — profile before optimizing.
- **Auth / secrets / untrusted input**: `security-and-hardening`.
- **Unclear**: treat as a bug, ask exactly one focused question, never guess.

## 3. Per-Item Fix Loop

For every item, in order:

1. **Reproduce** the item as the operator described it (click path, error text, screen size).
2. **Name the root cause**, not the symptom. No fix without a named cause.
3. **Apply the minimal fix** with the routed skill. One item, one fix.
4. **Simplify** with `code-simplification`: no dead code, no extra abstractions.
5. **Commit locally**: `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (#<issue>)`. Never push, never open a PR.
6. **Verify**: browser check for UI via **`playwright-cli`** (live DOM, console, network — zero uncaught errors; no other browser tool, `browser-testing-with-devtools` only for profiling), and targeted test runner for logic via `test-driven-development` covering modified files, following `verification-before-completion` for what counts as proven. Batch all DOM checks into one `playwright-cli eval`; a tool failing twice is abandoned, not retried — tooling that cannot verify leaves the item **unverified**, which is reported, not looped on forever. Do NOT run full test suites or redundant VBC sweeps per fix; the final pre-push gate in Station IV validates the overall state. Regression tests go at the seam that actually reproduces the bug (unit, integration, or e2e — whatever reaches the real pattern at the call site); when no correct seam exists, that itself is an architectural finding — record it in the commit and surface it in the report. During interactive/prototyping turns, or on explicit opt-out ("just build", "no browser check"), skip the browser check entirely and report the item as not browser-verified — the Station IV gate (or an explicit request) is where visual proof happens. Time-boxed: 5 minutes total from the first browser call, 90s per call — on expiry stop and report the item as unverified ("time-box expired"), never loop.
7. **Next item.** A red verification stops the loop until green.

## 4. Guardrails

Respect `CONSTRAINTS.md` (no skipped tests, no new external dependencies without approval, zero regressions in touched modules). Never touch code outside the reported items. Never push to origin — `iv-review-build-and-pr` is the only station that pushes.

## Final check walkthrough (mandatory input to the report)

Pre-IV verification gate — after the fixes, guide the operator through re-checking the change with their own eyes so they can loop again via `/iiib-iterate-after-build` or advance to Station IV. Build the walkthrough from the live product: name the real screen / tab / button, use as many short steps as it takes for clarity — no step cap — each step one quick action in the shape where → what to do → what to see, with `→` arrows and a direct link when one exists. Plain words, no jargon. Say exactly what to look at (text, state, count). Prefer visual proof. Nothing visual → one line saying so plus how it was checked automatically.
