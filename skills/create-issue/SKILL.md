# Intake: Create Issue (`create-issue`)

Turn one raw operator idea into one professional GitHub issue, publishable and
workable by any agent later — including a fresh session with no memory of this
conversation.

## Pipeline Position
- **Position:** Intake branch — **not a numbered station.** Invoked from Station I (`i-pick-issue`) when the backlog has nothing worth picking, or directly by the operator (`/create-issue <idea>`).
- **Previous Station:** none — this is the entry for a brand-new idea. When work is already in flight, `pipeline-triage` comes first.
- **Next Station:** `i-pick-issue` — the new issue re-enters Discovery and gets picked like any other.

## CodeRabbit posture for this skill

This skill talks to CodeRabbit in two places only: the issue-level plan request (step 7) and the output template closeout line. It does **not** rely on CodeRabbit to plan issues, label issues, or write the PR title. Those three are owned as follows on the current configuration:

- **Issue planning** — posted explicitly by this skill as `gh issue comment <n> --body "@coderabbitai plan\n<prompt body>"`. The prompt body lives in `references/coderabbit-plan-prompt.md`. Posting happens after the issue is published; there is no other trigger and no silent dependency on an automatic-plan feature.
- **Issue labeling** — done by this skill from `gh label list --limit 100` at publish time. CodeRabbit's automatic issue labeling, if it exists at all, is ignored: the workflow must work when CodeRabbit does not label issues.
- **PR title** — owned by CodeRabbit. The agent sets the PR title to exactly `@coderabbitai` and lets the root `.coderabbit.yaml` (`reviews.auto_title_placeholder` + `reviews.auto_title_instructions`) write the final title. The agent writes the *issue* title here in step 5; it does not write the PR title.

Do not add workflows that depend on plan-gated CodeRabbit features merely because they exist in the documentation: automatic repository linking, automatic issue planning, automatic issue labeling, and any other capability the Free/this-account tier refuses are out of scope (see `config/coderabbit/README.md` and the plan-gating table there).

## Workflow

1. **Read the tracker conventions.** Open the issue-tracker doc that ships with
   this skill at `references/issue-tracker.md` (relative to the skill root) and
   use its intake template and command conventions (auth pre-flight, body-file
   publishing, label fallbacks, split-failure handling). That doc is the single
   source of truth for the intake template itself — see it there, under
   "Raw idea intake → Intake template".
2. **Research before drafting.** Scan the repo for relevant files (search for
   symbols, render sites, config) so Relevant files names real paths with line
   numbers. An issue written without research is not ready-for-agent.
3. **Capture open questions in the issue.** If the operator's intent is
ambiguous, do NOT stop to interrogate: write each unclear point into the
issue under **Open questions** (what is unclear + why it matters + the
default assumption the next station should work with). Ask the operator only
when the idea cannot be drafted at all without an answer. Never guess intent
silently. Ambiguity is resolved by the issue body, not by a prerequisite label.
4. **Decide single vs split.** If the idea is one coherent change, draft it as
   a single issue (below). If it is really several separable work items — e.g.
   different files, different owners, or one part clearly blocks another — split
   it into multiple issues. Splitting is the agent's call: do it when a single
   issue would be too large to pick up cleanly or when the parts have distinct
   acceptance criteria. Never split a genuinely atomic idea just to multiply
   tickets.
5. **Draft in English with a tagged title.** Interpret the operator's raw words into the template
   sections; never quote them back. Title format: `[TAG] short plain-English summary`.
   Use exactly one primary TAG, chosen by the main purpose of the work:
   `[ADD]` new capability on top of what exists · `[CREATE]` a new file, module or service ·
   `[FIX]` wrong behaviour corrected · `[IMPROVE]` same behaviour, better ·
   `[REFACTOR]` moved or renamed, behaviour unchanged · `[OPTIMIZE]` faster or cheaper ·
   `[TEST]` tests only · `[DOCUMENT]` docs only · `[FORMAT]` whitespace, layout, lint ·
   `[UPDATE]` dependency or data refresh · `[CONFIGURE]` settings, workflows, tooling ·
   `[REVERT]` undo a previous change.
   Keep the summary short, specific, and in everyday English with no abbreviations — the same TAG
   vocabulary and decision logic that CodeRabbit uses for PR titles (see the root `.coderabbit.yaml` and
   `config/coderabbit/README.md`). For a split, each sibling gets its own title + TAG + body; keep the
   shared context in each so none reads as orphaned. This rule is for issue titles only — the agent
   writes the issue title here, and the PR title remains exactly `@coderabbitai` until CodeRabbit writes
   the final title. Do not make the agent generate the final PR title or duplicate CodeRabbit's PR-title
   responsibility.
6. **Publish immediately (No waiting for approval).** Once the draft is prepared
   (and any clarifying questions resolved), publish directly to GitHub without
   pausing to show the draft or waiting for user confirmation. Before publishing,
   run `gh label list --limit 100` so the full existing-label set is visible, then
   pass usually one to three *relevant existing* labels with `--label` to `gh issue create`
   (e.g. `gh issue create --title "[FIX] ..." --body-file <file> --label <existing-label>`).
   Use `ready-for-agent`, `needs-answers`, and `quick-fix` only when they exist and fit the
   issue; when no existing label fits, publish with no label at all. Never create a missing
   label, never invent a label, and never wait for CodeRabbit to add labels — a missing
   wanted label is skipped and named in the closeout. Pick labels from what the repo already
   carries; a small, practical set beats inventing a new taxonomy, and there is no reason to
   force a label when nothing genuinely fits. Keep any `quick-fix` the screening below
   selected (when the label exists), and keep it on an issue that already carries it; the 7-box
   gate rules and label removal on gate failure are unchanged. Do not attach a prerequisite
   label to defer the work; the issue body is the thing the agent resolves, not a label.
   - Split: publish every issue first, capture each `#number`, then wire them
     together so they are visibly one family, not orphans:
     - Put `Part of #<first-issue>` at the top of every later sibling's body —
       the header wording and the first-sibling exception are canonical in
       `references/issue-tracker.md` → Conventions.
     - Post a cross-reference comment on each issue pointing at the others, e.g.
       `gh issue comment <n> --body "Related: #<a>, #<b>"`.
     - If one part blocks another, add a native dependency edge:
       `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`
       where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric database id
       (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`), not the `#number`.
7. **Post CodeRabbit plan prompt — after publishing.** CodeRabbit does not plan
   issues by itself on the current plan; the agent must post the canonical
   `@coderabbitai plan` prompt stored in `references/coderabbit-plan-prompt.md` as its
   own issue comment, beginning with the exact lowercase mention `@coderabbitai plan`.
   Post it only after the issue is published — or, for a split, after every sibling is
   published and fully linked per step 6. This primes CodeRabbit while the operator/agent
   is in Station I.
   - **Post the prompt body, never the file.** The reference file is a doc: a heading, a note,
     and the prompt wrapped in a ```` ```text ```` fence. Passing it as-is would publish the wrapper
     and leave the `@coderabbitai` mention inside a code block. Write the fenced body to a temp file
     and pass that — `gh issue comment <n> --body-file <temp-prompt-file>` — or pass the body inline
     with `--body`. The posted comment begins with the exact lowercase mention `@coderabbitai plan`,
     contains the prompt body, and contains nothing else — no file path, no wrapper text. That is the same
     requirement the eval calls “post the canonical `@coderabbitai plan` prompt” — do not post the file,
     do not add a file path, and do not precede the mention with wrapper text.
   - **Skip the request for a genuinely trivial issue — and only for such an issue.** A typo-only,
     comment-only, or trivial docs change with no behavior change (the docs/typo/comment-only class)
     gets nothing back from phases and test cases: publish, report, and move on. Any other issue —
     including one carrying `quick-fix` — still gets the plan request.
   - **No wait, no retry.** Post the comment and move straight to the closeout — do not wait for a
     plan to land and do not repost the prompt.
8. **Closeout in chat:** You MUST report to the user following the Output Contract below. Never make the user wait before creation.

## Quick-fix screening

Intake is the cheapest place in the whole pipeline to notice trivial work: the idea
is still one sentence, so "typo" and "new auth provider" are still visibly different
sizes. Screen every idea, and when it reads as trivial keep the `quick-fix` label
when that label exists.

**The label is a signal, not a shortcut.** It tells Station I where to look first; it
does not grant the lane. `quick-fix` still runs its own hard 7-box gate at the
divert point, and a failed gate sends the work to the full pipeline with the label
removed. Sizing an idea wrong at intake is a recoverable mistake; a label that
bypasses the gate would not be.

Label the idea when it reads as: a typo, a stale comment, a broken link, a wrong
constant, a missing doc line, or a single obvious correction in at most a couple of
files — with no behavior change and no new test implied.

Do **not** label it because the operator called it "quick", because it is small on
its own, or because most of the work is already done. A split, or
anything implying a behavior change, all mean no label. A split is never labelled:
its parts are separate issues and each gets screened on its own.

The intake issue's final acceptance criterion is still a runnable verification
command, exactly as for any other issue — the lane verifies before it pushes, and a
`quick-fix` issue with no runnable command fails gate box 6 and routes to planning.

## Intake template

See `references/issue-tracker.md` → "Raw idea intake → Intake template" — it is
the single source of truth for the body of every intake issue (English only, the
operator's raw words are never quoted back, and the final acceptance criterion
must be a runnable verification command).

## Split variant

The rule is canonical in `references/issue-tracker.md` → Conventions (later
siblings lead with `Part of #`, the first carries only `Related:`, every sibling
gets a cross-reference comment, blockers get a native dependency edge — see
Workflow step 6). Example top of each *later* sibling body:

```markdown
Part of #<first-issue>  ·  Related: #<a>, #<b>

## Summary
...
```

## Quality bar

A published issue is ready-for-agent when a fresh agent, given only the issue
and repo access, can start work without asking the operator anything:
real file paths, an explicit out-of-scope line, and acceptance criteria whose
last item is a runnable verification command.
